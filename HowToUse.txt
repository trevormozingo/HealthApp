The Health Tracker uses data from the HealthKit. 
If no data already exists in the health kit, add sample data for
BMI and Active Energy. 

When running the health tracker, be sure to allow access to all data. 

The app will then list your BMI, and calories burned. You can then add
to your day consumption by listing foods you have eaten, the quanitiy, and
the calorie count. (There is an estimates page if you are unsure of the 
calorie count). 

With your day consumption listed, the home page will allow you to see
if you have a positive calorie gain, or loss. 

NOTE: If simulator starts running for the first time, the request to 
permit data access, may time out. If this occurs, go to the Health app, and
allow health tracker to access the data.
